- Project: Real-Time Object Detection System with Twilio SMS Alerts**

- **Tech Stack:** Python, OpenCV, PyTorch (YOLOv5), PyQt5, Twilio API

- **Description:**
Developed a real-time object detection system with a graphical user interface using PyQt5. Integrated YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once) deep learning model for object detection through webcam feed. Configured Twilio API to send automated SMS alerts when predefined objects (e.g., person, fire, knife) are detected. Enabled start/stop controls and live feed display within a desktop GUI application.

- **Key Features:**
* Real-time detection with webcam using OpenCV
* PyTorch-powered YOLOv5 object recognition
* GUI built using PyQt5 (.ui file based)
* Twilio SMS alerts triggered by specific object detection
* Modular design with separate components for detection, UI, and alerts
